## What is Goshaders?
Goshaders is a series of articles about the basics of shaders in godot, It will be primarly focused on 2D shaders basics with some practical examples and uses.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I assume some familiarity with the godot engine and some programming basics like [variables][variableLink] [conditions][conditionalLink] [functions][functionLink].

### What are shaders?
Shaders are small programs that runs on a GPU we use them to manipulate how graphics are rendered, It can be used for various effects such as, grass or leafs fluttering in the wind, glitch efftects, a slash effect or any other special graphical modification.

Shaders are fast really fast in a similar way to normal code, shaders are sets of instructions what's special about them is that shaders are run on every pixel/vertex in paralel.


> [!WARNING]
> Coding along is important to get a grip on many concepts, it's preferrable to try and experiment alone on every new thing you discover to master those concepts.
